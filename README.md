# Climate
A weather app built using **` API's `** 🔗
Link to the website : [Climate](https://sumitmule.github.io/climate/)
<br>

API's are a great way to learn about requests and response with the server.
In this project, I've used two api's : 

 - [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) ⛅
 - [Geolocation API](https://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation/) (It's an inbuilt feature in JS) 🏠

Geolocation API is used to get user location and based on that we fetch weather of that particular location throught OpenWeather API and display it on the Screen.

### Tech/Framework used :

1. Languages : HTML, CSS, JS
2. Code Editor : VS Code

### Instructions :

- To make use of these api's you need the api keys which you can get by signing up on their websites. 
- Using those keys you can make a call i.e. request and based on that you will get a **.json** response. 📄
<br>

### Things implemented in this project :

1. Use of API's and parsing the json response
2. Getting use location
3. Deploying a site on github

> The user experience can be improved by displaying weather data for multiple days and giving personalized alerts based on user's current location. 🔔
